### Description

Thanks to your awsome work on project-3, we now have over 30 unique published kaggle datasets. In this project, you will have the opportunity to work on one of those datasets gather by classmates, your work will include defining a problem statement, an extensive outline of EDA and modeling to date, and the goal of your predictive model.


The goal of project-4 is to apply **Time Series Models** or you can build a **Recommendation System**, based on the data you chose.

### Requirements

- Select a dataset from the following datasets:
  1. [DIGITAL CURRENCY MARKET (USD & SAR)](https://www.kaggle.com/ahmedadam415/digital-currency-time-series).
  2. [GameStop Historical Stock Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/hananxx/gamestop-historical-stock-prices)
  3. [Collecting children books data from amazon](https://www.kaggle.com/modhiibrahimalmannaa/1000-children-books-on-amazom)
  4. [Microsoft Stock Market](https://www.kaggle.com/rawaneid/microsoft-stock-market-2001-2021)
  5. [RS-PS4 Games](https://www.kaggle.com/ww1234/ps4-games) 
  6. [Goodreads-Computer-Books](https://www.kaggle.com/muneeralhajri/goodreadscomputerbooks)
  7. [Cocooncenter pharmacy](https://www.kaggle.com/kholoudowais/cocooncenter-pharmacy)
  And/or [Cocooncenter pharmacy](https://www.kaggle.com/reemalsh/cocooncenter-care-products)


  
- Describe selected dataset thoroughly.
- Define an issue or a problem that you are trying to solve.
- Clean and prepare your data.
- Perform methods of exploratory data analysis including some visualizations.
- Apply one of these models:
  1. **Recommendation system.** : Each group should have **two algorithms**. These algorithms can belong to either Content Based **or** Collaborative Filtering Systems.
  
  2. **Time series**: Each member of the group should build one algorithm, so you should have three algorithms per group. These algorithms should belong to ARIMA **and two more models** in which we **did not** cover in class. Please see examples in (SARIMAX lecture)

### Submission

- **Deadline: Thursday, 11th of February.**
- What to submit:
  1. Readme file contains a brief summary about your selected dataset and the defined problem.
  2. Notebook of your work.
